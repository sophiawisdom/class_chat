Chatroom announcement when user enters room ## DONE - took like 2 minutes

Make TODO etc. not visible to users ## DONE - only files that end with js, html, or css can be statically accessed.

Implement Message object ## DONE - not super useful

Make users able to see recent messages posted in room ## DONE - context value is maximum of 10

What if the same user opens the same chatroom twice? Kick one out? ## DONE - second user simply not allowed to enter. IDK what happens in the JS but the new user is not put on the users list.

Add real chatrooms instead of having a single one ## DONE Took for fucking ever but finally works.



Make chatroom view not look shitty
	I'm bad at HTML. This presents difficulties.

Add more commands
	/get_mac {username} or /get_ip {username}

	/kick {username}
	    just remove them from users table?
Implement saved users
	This would have to be based on mac addresses, not IP addresses. This would imply an IP -> Mac translation when encountering the user and then another one to match against mac. I still don't know how to do IP -> mac translations, so this is awkward.

What if a user tries to open a chatroom with the same name as an existing one?

Give chatroom creators authority
	Should this be the case? Maybe I should just be the sole authority arbitrating out of the passwords file

Send PM's?
    Maybe this could work through the same mechanism that server messages work on

Protect against Javascript/HTML injection
    I believe anyone should be able to just write html onto other people's computers, effectively. This isn't a huge deal - I think I'm fine with it being there. This is on a protected local network, and it's just JS/HTML, by design nothing too harmful

More intuitive interface to change name
    simple to explain, harder to do

Leave chat at page close

When username is changed, no message is sent to original user at present

Persist chatrooms?

Allow hidden chatrooms?
